# while reading xml file. Keep list of all products and all reactants. (dictionary)

# throw out everything that is not both reactant and product (not in a circle)

# while there are still keys in dictionary:
	# take value as key for next until initial returns (count)

# whichever list is longest
# choose random int between 0 and len(count) - 1 start there. End at int -1
